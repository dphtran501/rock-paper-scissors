A simple game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors).

Users play a game of five rounds against the computer in the console. At the end of each round, the winner of the round gets a point. If there's a tie, noone gets a point and the game continues to the next round. At the end of five rounds, the winner is declared based on the final score (if the scores are tied, a tie is declared).
